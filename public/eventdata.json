It was the main venue for the eighth Olympiad in 1924, staging the opening ceremony and athletics events for instance. A unique venue in France, it is the only one that will host the second Games in its history in 2024, staging the hockey competitions.",
                        "Until 1972, when the Parc des Princes was inaugurated, the Yves-du-Manoir multi-sports venue, named after a French rugby player, was the main stadium in the Paris Region. Located in Colombes, northwest of Paris, it has hosted around 250 national and international competitions over the past century, from athletics to rugby, football and even boxing, including the World Championship in 1972, in front of 40,000 spectators.",
                        "Yves-du-Manoir Stadium has already been renovated several times, and the Hauts-de-Seine department, which owns this facility, will be launching a modernisation programme to benefit its communities, associations, schools and universities."
